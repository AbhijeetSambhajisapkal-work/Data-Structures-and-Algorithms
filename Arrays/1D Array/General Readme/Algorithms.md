# Common Algorithms for Array Data Structure

This document lists important algorithms frequently used with arrays in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

## 1. Linear Search
- Traverse the array to find a target element.
- Time Complexity: O(n)

## 2. Binary Search
- Efficiently search for an element in a sorted array.
- Time Complexity: O(log n)

## 3. Kadane’s Algorithm
- Find the maximum sum subarray (contiguous).
- Time Complexity: O(n)

## 4. Merge Intervals
- Merge overlapping intervals in an array of intervals.

## 5. Dutch National Flag Algorithm
- Sort an array of 0s, 1s, and 2s (or partition into three parts).
- Time Complexity: O(n)

## 6. Moore’s Voting Algorithm
- Find the majority element in an array.
- Time Complexity: O(n)

## 7. Quickselect Algorithm
- Find the k-th smallest/largest element.
- Average Time Complexity: O(n)

## 8. Sieve of Eratosthenes (for array of numbers)
- Find all primes up to n.
- Time Complexity: O(n log log n)

## 9. Prefix Sum / Suffix Sum Algorithms
- Precompute cumulative sums for range queries.
- Time Complexity: O(n) for preprocessing, O(1) per query

## 10. Two Pointer Algorithms
- Solve problems like pair sum, remove duplicates, etc.
- Time Complexity: O(n)

## 11. Sliding Window Algorithms
- Find subarrays/substrings with certain properties.
- Time Complexity: O(n)

## 12. Next Greater/Smaller Element (using Stack)
- Find next greater/smaller element for each array element.
- Time Complexity: O(n)

## 13. Array Rotation Algorithms
- Rotate array by k positions (using reversal or juggling algorithm).
- Time Complexity: O(n)

## 14. Sorting Algorithms (on arrays)
- Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, Counting Sort, etc.

## 15. Difference Array Algorithm
