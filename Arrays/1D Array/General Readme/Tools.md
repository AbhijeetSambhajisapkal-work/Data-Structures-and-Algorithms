# Array DSA Problem Solving Tools

This document lists common techniques and tools used to solve array-based Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems.

## 1. Two Pointer Approach
- Use two pointers to traverse the array from different directions or at different speeds.
- Commonly used for problems involving sorted arrays, searching pairs, or removing duplicates.

## 2. Sliding Window Technique
- Maintain a window (subarray) that slides over the array to solve problems involving subarrays or substrings.
- Useful for finding maximum/minimum sum subarrays, longest/shortest subarrays with certain properties, etc.

## 3. Subarray
- A contiguous part of an array.
- Many problems ask for the sum, product, or properties of subarrays.

## 4. Prefix Sum
- Precompute the cumulative sum of elements up to each index.
- Allows for efficient range sum queries.

## 5. Suffix Sum
- Precompute the cumulative sum of elements from each index to the end.
- Useful for problems requiring sums from the end of the array.

## 6. Hashing / Hash Map
- Use hash maps to store frequencies, indices, or to check for existence of elements.
- Useful for problems involving subarrays with given sum, duplicates, etc.

## 7. Sorting
- Sort the array to simplify searching, pairing, or deduplication problems.

## 8. Binary Search
- Efficiently search for an element or condition in a sorted array.

## 9. Kadane’s Algorithm
- Find the maximum sum subarray in O(n) time.

## 10. Difference Array
- Efficiently perform range update operations on arrays.

## 11. Stack/Monotonic Stack
- Used for problems involving next/previous greater or smaller elements.

## 12. Frequency Array
- Store the count of each element, useful for counting and comparison problems.
